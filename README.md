# Route Optimization 🛣️

## Project Overview 🚀

This project tackles an algorithmic challenge related to route optimization on a road network. The primary objective is to discover the most efficient route connecting a subset of cities, considering the anticipated traffic on each road segment at various time slots.

## Approach 🧠

To address this problem, we employed a combination of techniques:

- **Adjacency Matrix Representation**: We utilized an adjacency matrix to model cities and their connections, including associated time costs.
  
- **Genetic Algorithm**: We implemented a genetic algorithm approach, leveraging concepts such as fitness, generation, population, crossover, and mutation. This iterative process allowed us to continuously refine the routes and minimize the overall duration.

## Resources 📚

- Jupyter Notebook: We documented our methodology, experimentation, and results in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.

- Linear Programming & Metaheuristics: We leveraged concepts from linear programming and metaheuristics to devise and optimize our solution.

## Skills Utilized 🛠️

- **Python (Programming Language)**: The entire project was implemented in Python, harnessing its flexibility and powerful libraries for scientific computing and optimization.
